Here are a few miscellaneous links to resources that may save you some time. 

## Books

You can find a large portion of the textbooks required for classes online. Since it doesn't make sense for people to repeat the same search every year for textbooks we have assembled a dropbox folder containing all the currently known books. If you find a new book make sure to [Slack](https://biostats.slack.com) it to Nick and he can add it.
